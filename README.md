Medusa is a complete open source Shopify alternative . It was originally created in collaboration with a client, Tekla Fabrics, to provide them with a scalable and unique ecommerce setup.

## What is Medusajs ?

Medusa is an open source alternative to Shopify that provides many of the same standard features that Shopify's backend provides out of the box, such as E2E order handling, an easy-to-use admin interface, and so on, but it is more heavily focused on giving users and developers the flexibility to customize the solution and take ownership of the entire commerce stack.Furthermore, medusa aimed to address some of Shopify's common backend issues, such as full multi-regional support (local currency, shipment, and payment options) and fully automated exchange and claim handling.
